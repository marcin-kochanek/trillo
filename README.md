# Trillo

Trillo is a fictional all-in-one booking app (user can book a hotel, a flight, a car and a tour all in one platform) I made in Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course Advanced CSS and Sass: Take your CSS to the next level.

In this project I learnt the fundamental concepts and properties behind the Flexbox layout and some advanced CSS properties like custom variables, masks and SVGs. 

See it [here](https://marcin-kochanek.github.io/trillo).
